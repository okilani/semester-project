Our code presents two distinct games on the start screen: a reaction time test and a timer-based challenge. In the reaction time test, targets appear at various locations with a one-minute countdown, assessing how many targets you hit. In the timer game, you aim to hit 15 targets while the timer increases. Missing a target deducts a heart (three hearts total); after losing all hearts, it's game over.

The purpose of our developing a reaction time test help measure how quickly someone thinks and responds. It's like a digital stopwatch for the brain. This test is useful for sports, studying the brain, and designing user-friendly technology.

Our plan during this process was to first begin with setting up the format of the game where Gaith and Abdallah worked on the buttons and Talal and Omar worked on the background and the target shape. Next, which we believe was the most difficult part was where we had to figure out how to make the program check that the user's click landed in the circle. The whole group contributed to this section because it required all of us to think and come up with a solution. The timer was done by Talal, and the scoring was done by Abdallah and Gaith.

A pivotal breakthrough in our coding journey occurred when we cracked the method to make the program check if the user's click landed inside the circle, executing the action only once. It was a key step forward in our coding journey, in which we were stuck on for almost 2 weeks! As a group, we believe this was the key part to our code because after it everything moved on smoothly and with ease.
